/**
 * What {@link SQLDatabase#onUpgrade} does to a database an older release left behind. Nothing else
 * runs it, so every case here is the only thing standing behind a step of it.
 *
 * Three cases are a database that has never held the join table, at each of the versions a release
 * stamped without it: 2, which upstream stamped up to 4.0.4.1, 3, which it stamped from then on and
 * so did every release of this app up to 1.5.0, and 4, which 1.6.0 stamped. A version 1 database
 * takes the same path as a version 2 one, the step between them having been withdrawn. Their tables
 * are written out here instead of taken from {@link Schema}, because Schema is what a fresh install
 * gets today and a migration reads what a shipped release wrote. The columns the later two arrive
 * with are the exception, added by the same statements the migration would have added them with.
 *
 * A fourth is a database this app wrote with the version put back to 3, which is what installing a
 * release older than the one that wrote it leaves, since onDowngrade does nothing and the helper
 * stamps the version anyway. That one uses Schema, the schema being the one it wrote. A fifth is a
 * database the migration cannot convert at all.
 *
 * Four cases after those cover the step that moves nine currencies to two decimals, all on a
 * database this app wrote at version 5: the money it carries, the same database arriving a second
 * time, a currency the owner had already set above zero, and the asset file agreeing with the list
 * the step walks.
 *
 * No budget here is flagged deleted, because none can be. The delete is a real delete on every
 * build ever shipped, the soft delete beside it was gated on a constant that has read false since
 * the initial commit and came out in 06b9009, and a backup carries no deleted budget either.
