Cash Ledger tracks what you spend and what you have, across as many wallets as you keep. It runs with no network connection and asks for no account. [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) lists every way data leaves the app.

The F-Droid build is reproducible and carries the developer signature, so the app from F-Droid and the APK attached to each [release](https://github.com/solomonrajan/cashledger/releases) are interchangeable.

## What it does

- **Wallets.** Keep as many as you need, each in its own currency.
- **Categories.** Group spending into categories and subcategories, and open a category total into the ones underneath it.
- **Budgets.** Set a limit for a period, cover more than one category with it, and let it repeat into the next period on its own.
- **Recurring transactions.** Post on a schedule you set, including transfers between wallets.
- **Debts and savings goals.** Track what you owe, what you are owed, and what you are putting aside.
- **Reports.** See a period's income and spending, with charts by category.
- **Calendar.** A day strip marks the days that have transactions.
- **Widget.** A home screen widget shows one wallet's balance.
- **Backup.** Write to a local folder, to your own WebDAV server such as Nextcloud or a NAS, or through Android's own backup.
- **Import and export.** CSV in, and CSV, XLS or PDF out, plus the older MoneyWallet backup file.
- **Lock.** An optional PIN, pattern or fingerprint when the app opens.

## Coming from MoneyWallet

Cash Ledger is a maintained fork of [MoneyWallet](https://github.com/AndreAle94/moneywallet), which last had a release in 2021. It is a separate app with its own application id, so it installs beside the original and does not replace it or carry its data across on its own. [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) has the path that was tested.

## Docs

- [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md)
- [Moving from MoneyWallet](MIGRATION.md)

Every release note is on the [releases page](https://github.com/solomonrajan/cashledger/releases).

## Build from source

Build the `floss` + `osm` flavors, which use OpenStreetMap and no proprietary services:

```
./gradlew assembleFlossOsmDebug
```

Requirements: a recent Android SDK and JDK 17 or newer. Release builds use JDK 21, which is what the F-Droid build server uses, so a release built on an older JDK will not reproduce.
